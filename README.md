Python Robot Arm
I wanted to use a Web GUI to control the robot but ran into an error.
So if you download this please user TKGui.py to control your robot arm.

The Python Robot Arm will come with a startup file for the users. This will allow you to start up the program without having to worry about dependencies or other software required to run the program.
1.	The user will need to download the program from https://github.com/jello261/Robot-Arm 
2.	Next, open the terminal on the raspberry pi of your choosing. 
3.	Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the software. 
4.	Next, run the startup.sh script to download all the depends for the application by running the command   “sudo ./startup.sh”
5.	Next, run the command “python3 TKGui.py”
6.	Now you will see a user interface. (see picture below)
7.	First, you must always home the robot so the software and hardware can be in sync.
8.	Now you have full control to tell the robot to move in any direction.
